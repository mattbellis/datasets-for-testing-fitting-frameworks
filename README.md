## How to use 

* Set up your framework to read in the dataset.
* Each dataset comes with some suggested hypotheses to test. Pick one!
* Each hypothesis will have required naming conventions for the parameters. This is to standardize comparison among frameworks. 
* Your framework should return, for each value
    * The central value
    * The 1-sigma uncertainties
    * *Optional* Confidence intervals
    * *Optional* Change in values for nuisance parameters.
